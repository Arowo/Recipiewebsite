<h1>Amala</h1>
<p>Amala is a traditional Nigerian meal eaten by the Yoruba ethnic group in the country’s western states. It’s manufactured using unripe plantain flour, yam flour, and/or cassava flour.
    As a popular Nigerian dish, it’s difficult to go to any of the local bukkas in Lagos or Ibadan without seeing this dish on the menu.
    The beautiful thing about this Yoruba special is that it is quick and easy to make, but if you aren’t careful, you could end up with lumps that make it unappealing to eat. If you struggle with making lump free, fluffy, smooth Amala, relax because with this recipe you’ll get it under control.
    What Is Amala Made Of?
    Yams are peeled, cut, washed, and dried before being ground into a flour known as èlùbo. Yams are white when fresh, but when dried, they turn brown. This is how àmàlà is made of and gets its color.
    
    It is a West African dish consumed mostly by the Yoruba people of Nigeria, particularly in the state of Oyo. Ibadan people do not play with amala and ewedu, likewise akpu na ofe onuigbu for an Igbo man/
    
    <h2>Types Of Amala</h2>
    <b>Yam flour (isu):</b> This is the most popular àmàlà, and it is made from yam. Because of its high starch content, Dioscorea cayenensis also known as West African yam or white yam is the ideal yam specie for making amala. Yam grows throughout Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Latin America, and is the common name for plants in the genus Dioscorea.
    
    Dried yam is used to make it. When added to boiling water, it turns a black/brownish color. It is quite high in carbohydrates since yam is a major source of carbohydrate for many people in Sub-Saharan Africa.
    
    <b>Cassava flour (láfún):</b> This is made from cassava flour, is the second type. In Nigeria, dried cassava flour is known as “lafun.” Cassava is another prominent source of carbohydrate, with Nigeria as the world’s leading producer.
    
    Cassava flour used to make amala is known as “Kokente” in Ghana. From cassava, Garri, a  fermented and flaky meal popular among the Ijebu people, is another common cuisine used in eating soups.
    
 <b> Plantain flour (ogede):</b> Elubo ogede is another form of this flour mix (which is usually lighter in color). Plantain flour’s low carbohydrate content makes it ideal for diabetics and those who require a low-carbohydrate diet.
    
    Unripe plantains are peeled, dried, and grated into boiling water to make it. The outcome is usually light brownish.
